summary: "A program that can solve any sudoku problem."
---

In this project, I created a program that can solve any sudoku problem. This program works by looping through the rows and column of the sudoku problem. Whenever there is a 0 in the sudoku problem, a function to get the possible values were called. Each possible value is tested by checking if the same number is in the same row, column or 3 x 3, if all of these conditions are satisfied, the number is plotted. This process is repeated until the sudoku is solved 

This is an example of my program solving a sudoku problem:
