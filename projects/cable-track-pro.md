## Overview

[CableTrack.Pro](https://ingeniouspartners.github.io/cabletrack.pro/) is a tool to help electricians to quickly and easily create schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and test. All of this is designed to allow the electricians to more efficiently create the Building Information Management (BIM) reports and exports for their projects.

This application was created with the help of my team, the [Indigenous Partners](https://github.com/ingeniouspartners). My team consisted of Andrea Jans, Ursula Nichols, Matthew Yamamoto, and Mikhail Shkaralevich. My role in this project was a software engineer. We are a group of ingenious people building applications.

## Contributions

My contributions to this project include:
- Creating Project Pages (add project page, edit project page, view project page and the list project page).
- Creating add, edit, view, list, delete features for projects.
- Testcafe tests for Projects

## What I learned

Through this project, I learned many technical things, such as how to better use meteor, mongodb, deployment, and react. I had many issues in the beginning of the project with how everything worked, such as the meteor template that we were using. But as time went on, I started to understand the ins and outs of the program and how everything worked. It took long hours to understand, but it was worth it. This was my first team based project, so I learned what it is like to work in a team coding project. My most important takeaway from this project was the team project experience.  Some important things that I think are the key to success in a team is communication and adaptability. Communication is key to a successful project. Talking about your own progress and challenges with your code are important to keep the project moving forward. I think that my team could've communicated better and more efficiently, but overall I think we did a pretty great job.The final project really taught me how to adapt and be patient with my code. I found myself getting frustrated when I merge from main and my code wouldn't work. Being able to adapt and be patient with my code really helped me get through this project. This project really helped me to understand how important software engineering principles, like design patterns and project management are. The design pattern that was an important part of our project was the Model-View-Design Pattern (MVD). This pattern was used to separate the logic and data from the user interface. Design patterns assist a software engineering to create a structured solution to any problems. Issue driven project management allowed my team to easily track our progress on the project. This project has taught me many things that I will take with me into the future of software engineering.
