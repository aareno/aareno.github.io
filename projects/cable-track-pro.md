## Overview

[CableTrack.Pro](https://ingeniouspartners.github.io/cabletrack.pro/) is a tool to help electricians to quickly and easily create schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and test. All of this is designed to allow the electricians to more efficiently create the Building Information Management (BIM) reports and exports for their projects.

This application was created with the help of my team, the [Indigenous Partners](https://github.com/ingeniouspartners). My team consisted of Andrea Jans, Ursula Nichols, Matthew Yamamoto, and Mikhail Shkaralevich. My role in this project was a software engineer. We are a group of ingenious people building applications.

## Contributions

My contributions to this project include:
- Creating Project Pages (add project page, edit project page, view project page and the list project page).
- Creating add, edit, view, list, delete features for projects.
- Testcafe for Projects


## What I learned

Through this project, I learned many technical things, such as how to better use meteor, mongodb and react. This was my first team based project, so I learned what it is like to work in a team project. Some important takeaways from this project that I think are important are communication and adaptability. Communication is key to a successful project. I think talking about your own progress and challenges with your code are important to keep the project moving forward. The final project really taught me how to adapt and be patient with my code. I found myself getting frustrated when I merge from main and my code wouldn't work. Being able to adapt and be patient with my code really helped me get through this project.
