# My thoughts on:

## Javascript

  While using Javascript, it reminded me of using a mixture of python and Java. I've been liking the syntanx of javascript because it reminds of java and some of the functions that you can use remind of python. Overall, I think Javascript is a good programming lanauguge. I think it's a good programming languauge because it allows websites to be more interactive, which improves a users experience on a website. I think the syntax of Javascript is easy to learn because it is really similar to other coding langaugues. My favorite programming languauge is C, but maybe it will change by the end of the course. 

## Athletic Software Engineering / WoDs

  I think athletic software engineering is a better way of teaching compared to the traditional teaching style. I think many skills from computer science can only be learned through practice. Reading from a book and watching videos can only teach you so much. Applying the knowledge from the readings / videos to your own coding projects is what allows you to learn more. I think the WoDs and practice WoDs are really useful. It allows us to become more efficent when writing code and helps us to develop better coding habits. This style of learning is more stressful, but it gives us more practice with coding, which will make us better software engineers in the long run. I think the WoDs are fun even though they are stressful. It's always fun to challenge yourself, even if you fail you can always learn from your mistakes. Overall, I think this way of learning will allow me to learn more in a fun and challenging way.
