Something that I learned when preparing for the WOD is the javascript syntax. It was my first time using javascript, so doing the freecodecamp excercises really helped. During the WOD, I noticed that my coding skills are pretty rusty. I haven't done a coding class in a while, so these WODs will be a good way to get the gears turning again. To improve on the next WOD, something that I could do is practice WODs and other coding problems online in javascript. I think this experience was really valueable to see how I code under pressure. I found that I made simple mistakes, which costed me extra time wasted. I implemented the function the way I did because I found it the quickest and most simple way. While it wasn't the most efficient it did the job. If I were to do it again, I would make sure that the function acted more like a function, in a way that it can be used in other function. I think dicussing the WOD was really useful because it made me think about the flaws in my code and gave me a different way to think approach the problem.
