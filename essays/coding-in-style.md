## What is Coding Style?

Coding style are guidelines that developers follow while writing code. The goal of coding style is to make code more readable and to keep consistency throughout different projects. By using coding style, developers can remove bad habits and gain good habits while writing code.

## Reflection

I believe that coding style can help you learn a programming. Coding style reinforce consistency in all of the coding projects that you do. A big part of coding style is self-review and improvement. Reviewing your code can help understand the coding language better. After one week of using ESLint, I think it is really helpful. Sometimes it can be a pain to go back to fix something small that won't affect the code, but I think it makes the code a lot cleaner and readable. In my opinion, the green check mark is satisfying.
