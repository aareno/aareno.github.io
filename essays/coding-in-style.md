## What is Coding Style?

Coding style are guidelines that developers follow while writing code. The goal of coding style is to make code more readable and to keep consistency throughout different projects. This is especially important in team based projects where multiple people are working on the same application. By using coding style, developers can remove bad habits and gain good habits while writing code. 

## Reflection

I believe that coding style can help you learn a programming languauge. Coding style can reinforce consistency in all of the coding projects that you work on. A big part of coding style is self-review and improvement. Reviewing your code can help you understand the coding language better and to remember the languages syntax. I think once you learn one coding languauge well, It makes it a lot easier to learn other languages. Coding style can translate to any coding language. Through my experience, I can say that coding style has helped me learn coding languages better. In my first coding class (ICS111), we used coding style for java, I think it helped me make a good foundation for coding. After one week of using ESLint, I think it is really helpful. Sometimes it can be a pain to go back to fix something small that won't affect the code, but I think it makes the code a lot cleaner and readable. In my opinion, the green check mark is satisfying, it gives me a sense of completion when I see the green check mark and my code is working correctly.
