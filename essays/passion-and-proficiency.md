## Interest

Some of my interest are software development, web design / development, mobile app development, and videogame design. During the summer, I tried making my own website. I didn't end up finishing it, but it gave me a little introduction to how to code using html and how to make a website interactive using css. I'm excited to learn more about developing different software applications. By the end of the semester, I hope to make either a small website or application to add to my projects in my portfolio and to get a better understanding of being a software engineer.  

## Skills

I am proficient at writing code in java, python, C and C++. I have some knowledge of coding in html, css and I am currently learning javascript. I also have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. Other skills that I have include teamwork, willingness to learn more, and perseverence.  

## Experiences

When I first entered UH Manoa, I had no coding experience. I would write code without knowing what it's doing, as long as it worked. Overtime I learned how the code actually works.
