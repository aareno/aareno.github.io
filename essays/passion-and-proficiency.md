## Interest

Some of my interests are software development, web design / development, mobile app development, and videogame design. During the summer, I tried making my own website. I did not end up finishing it, but it gave me a little introduction to how to code using HTML and how to make a website interactive using CSS. I am excited to learn more about developing different software applications. By the end of the semester, I hope to make either a small website or application to add to my projects in my portfolio and to get a better understanding of being a software engineer.  

## Skills

I am proficient at writing code in java, python, C and C++. I have some knowledge of coding in html and css. I am currently learning JavaScript. I also have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. Other skills that I have include teamwork, willingness to learn more, and perseverence. 

In the future, I hope to gain more knowledge about software engineering to become a better developer. Some skills that I hope to acquire are proficiency in web development, working in databases, and being able to easily identify issues in code and fix it. I would also like to learn more about software architecture to understand the software development process more. 

## Experiences

During the summer, I hope to get a computer science internship. Through this experience, I hope to learn more about the job of a software engineer and being able to apply what I learned from ICS classes to the real world. Into the far future, I hope to contribute into making an application. Also, I hope to live a healthy work-life balance.
